I am Junya Yamaguchi (usually going by @openjny), a Japanese guy working at Microsoft as Cloud Solution Architect. While my professional speciality is Azure Infrastructure, I pretty much enjoy diverse genres such as Machine Learning and PenTesting. I currently live in TokyoðŸ—¼, playing tourist from time to time.
